      "As a mental health counselling assistant, I can help you explore the underlying emotions and thoughts that may be contributing to your feelings of inadequacy. It sounds like you may be experiencing imposter syndrome, which is a common feeling among high-achieving individuals. This can lead to feelings of self-doubt, anxiety, and depression. However, it's important to remember that everyone has their own unique strengths and weaknesses, and that it's okay to make mistakes and learn from them. It may be helpful to practice self-compassion and remind yourself that you are doing the best you can. Additionally, it may be helpful to challenge the negative thoughts and beliefs that are contributing to your feelings of inadequacy. For example, instead of thinking \"I'm not good enough,\" you could try reframing that thought to \"I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough.\" By practicing self-compassion and challenging negative thoughts, you can begin to build a more positive and self-affirming mindset.\n",
