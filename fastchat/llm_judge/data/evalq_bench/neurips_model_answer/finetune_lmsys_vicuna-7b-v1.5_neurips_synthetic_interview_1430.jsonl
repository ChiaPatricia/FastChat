It's important to remember that you're not alone in this struggle, and there are steps you can take to improve your situation.\n\nFirstly, it might be helpful to try gradually exposing yourself to foods that make you anxious or cause discomfort. Start with small portions and slowly increase the amount over time. This can help desensitize your body and mind to the fear of eating certain foods.\n\nAdditionally, practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation could be beneficial for managing your anxiety.

CBT focuses on identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and behaviors associated with these issues. A therapist trained in CBT can guide you through this process and provide you with effective coping strategies.\n\nIn addition to therapy, consider reaching out to support groups or online communities where you can connect with others who have experienced similar challenges. Sharing your story and hearing from others who have overcome their own struggles can provide validation and encouragement.\n\nLastly, self-care is crucial in managing anxiety and eating disorders.
