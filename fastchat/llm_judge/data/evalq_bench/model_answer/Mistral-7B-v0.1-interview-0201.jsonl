Hospitals can provide a structured environment and resources that can help him manage his symptoms and learn coping skills. It's understandable that he's resisting the idea of going, but it's crucial to prioritize his long-term well-being over his short-term comfort.\n\nI'd also recommend exploring alternative therapies, such as art therapy or equine therapy, which can offer unique perspectives and approaches to healing.
