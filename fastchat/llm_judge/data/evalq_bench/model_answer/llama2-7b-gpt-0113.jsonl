It's important to recognize that you're not alone in this experience, and many individuals have similar struggles when it comes to social situations.\n\nFirstly, it's great to hear that you have a high level of intelligence and can complete tasks easily when you're by yourself. This suggests that the root cause of your social anxiety may be related to the pressure and expectations you place on yourself in front of others.\n\nDissociating and feeling like your brain goes mush in social situations is a common symptom of social anxiety. It can be overwhelming and make even simple tasks feel incredibly difficult. However, there are strategies and techniques that can help you manage these feelings and improve your confidence in social situations.\n\nOne approach you might find helpful is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT focuses on identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to social anxiety. A therapist can work with you to identify the underlying causes of your anxiety and teach you techniques to reframe your thoughts and behaviors in more constructive ways.\n\nAnother technique that may be beneficial is exposure therapy. Exposure therapy involves gradually exposing yourself to social situations that trigger anxiety, starting with small steps. For example, you could begin by engaging in small talk with a small group of friends or acquaintances, and then gradually work your way up to more challenging situations. The goal is to help you become desensitized to the anxiety-provoking situations over time.\n\nIn addition to therapy, there are also some self-help strategies you can try to manage social anxiety. Practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, can help calm your body and mind in social situations. Engaging in regular exercise and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can also help reduce overall anxiety levels.\n\nIt's important to remember that overcoming social anxiety takes time and patience. It can be helpful to start small and set achievable goals for yourself, such as attending a small social gathering or engaging in a brief conversation with a stranger.

Having someone to talk to and share your thoughts and emotions with can make a significant difference in how you feel. While it may seem like that source of support has disappeared, there are other options you can explore to find new ways of connecting with others.\n\nOne suggestion is to try reaching out to different people in your life, such as friends, family members, or even joining a support group. Connecting with others who have gone through similar experiences can provide a sense of understanding and validation. You may find comfort in sharing your feelings with others who can offer empathy and support.\n\nAdditionally, you could consider engaging in activities that bring you even a small amount of joy or fulfillment. This might involve revisiting hobbies or interests you used to enjoy before feeling this way, or exploring new activities that have the potential to bring you happiness. Engaging in activities that give you a sense of purpose and enjoyment can help counteract the feelings of sadness and unmotivation.\n\nAnother important aspect to focus on is self-care. Taking care of yourself, both physically and emotionally, can help alleviate some of the stress and emptiness you're experiencing. This can involve practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation, to help manage your emotions. Prioritizing self-care can also involve getting enough rest, eating nourishing foods, and engaging in activities that promote overall well-being.\n\nLastly, if you find that these feelings persist and become overwhelming, it may be helpful to consider seeking professional help from a mental health therapist.

For example, when the little voice says you can't do something, you can challenge that thought by asking yourself for evidence of why you think that, and then replacing it with a more balanced and realistic perspective.\n\nIn addition to these techniques, it can also be beneficial to explore the root causes of your self-doubt.

Understand that you are not alone: Developing a phobia after a traumatic experience is not uncommon. Many people have faced similar situations and have successfully overcome their fears with the right support and techniques.\n2.

When we die, the brain's neural activity slows down and eventually stops, which can lead to a loss of consciousness. This is a scientifically recognized process known as brain death.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the exact nature of consciousness after death is still a topic of ongoing research and debate in the fields of neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy. Some theories suggest that consciousness may persist in some form after the physical body has died, while others propose that consciousness ceases to exist upon brain death.\n\nRegarding your specific fears, it's important to understand that the process of decomposition or cremation is a natural part of the decomposition process after death. These processes do not directly involve the consciousness or awareness of the individual. Decomposition occurs as microorganisms break down the body's tissues, while cremation involves the use of heat to transform the body into ash.\n\nAs for the fear of suffocating due to not breathing, it's important to remember that breathing is a vital function that is regulated by the body's autonomic nervous system. When we die, the body's breathing patterns can slow down and eventually stop, which can help reduce the risk of suffocation.\n\nWhile I can provide some insights and perspectives, it's important to remember that death is a complex and multifaceted experience that cannot be fully understood or predicted. It's natural to have uncertainties and fears, but it can be helpful to focus on the things that bring you comfort, peace, and meaning in the present moment.\n\nIf you find that your fears and anxieties are significantly impacting your daily life, it may be beneficial to consider seeking support from a mental health professional.

One possibility is that the anxiety itself is causing your body to release chemicals that can lead to nausea and vomiting. This can happen as a result of the intense stress and fear associated with panic attacks.\n\nAnother possibility is that the hyperventilation that occurs during panic attacks can lead to a buildup of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, which can cause nausea and vomiting.

However, there are strategies and techniques that can help you manage your symptoms and improve your overall functioning.\n\nOne approach that may be helpful is to break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. By doing so, you can create a sense of structure and routine, which can make it easier to stay on track and avoid feeling overwhelmed. Additionally, consider using tools such as calendars, planners, or reminders to help you stay organized and keep track of your responsibilities.\n\nAnother technique that may be useful is time management. This can involve prioritizing your tasks based on their importance and deadlines, and then allocating specific times for each task. By having a clear schedule and sticking to it, you may find it easier to stay focused and avoid procrastination.\n\nIn addition to these strategies, it may be beneficial to explore mindfulness and relaxation techniques. Mindfulness practices, such as deep breathing or meditation, can help you become more aware of your thoughts and emotions, and can reduce feelings of anxiety and overwhelm. Regular exercise, proper sleep hygiene, and maintaining a balanced diet can also have a positive impact on your overall well-being and executive functioning.\n\nFinally, it's important to address the underlying fears and beliefs that may be contributing to your struggles. Reflecting on the reasons behind your fear of commitment and longevity, and exploring healthier ways to approach these concerns, can be an important step in overcoming them.\n\nRemember, everyone's journey is unique, and it may take some trial and error to find the strategies that work best for"]}], "tstamp": 1705939663.691312}

It's understandable that you might have concerns about the long-term effects of medication, but it's important to remember that therapy can also be a long-term commitment. Together with your therapist, you can work on addressing the root causes of your anxiety and develop a comprehensive plan that suits your needs.\n\nIn terms of your experience with ignoring your anxiety in the past, it's important to recognize that avoiding or suppressing anxiety symptoms can often lead to a cycle of worsening anxiety. By actively engaging in therapy and potentially exploring medication, you can learn how to manage your anxiety in a healthier and more sustainable way.\n\nRegarding the impact of concussions on anxiety, it's important to discuss this with your therapist as well. Traumatic brain injuries, including concussions, can indeed affect mood regulation and increase the risk of anxiety. Your therapist can help you explore how these injuries may be contributing to your anxiety and develop strategies to address these challenges.\n\nAs for your question about whether to start therapy or medication first, it ultimately depends on your individual circumstances and preferences.

It's possible that you may be putting pressure on yourself to fit in or conform to the expectations of others, leading to these feelings of not belonging.\n\nTo address these feelings, there are a few strategies you could consider:\n\n1. Practice self-acceptance: Start by accepting yourself as you are, with all your quirks and imperfections. Remind yourself that everyone has their own unique personality and style, and that it's okay to be different.\n2. Challenge negative thoughts: When you start feeling like you don't belong, try to challenge those thoughts by asking yourself if they are based on evidence or if they are just assumptions. Replace negative thoughts with more realistic and positive ones.\n3. Focus on shared interests: Instead of worrying about fitting in with the group, try to find common interests or topics of conversation that you can engage in with others. This can help you connect with people on a more meaningful level and reduce feelings of disconnection.\n4. Take small steps: Gradually expose yourself to social situations, starting with small steps outside of your comfort zone.

In your case, it seems that comments or discussions about sexual preferences or corrupt behavior can trigger these episodes. By becoming aware of these triggers, you can start to develop strategies to address them.\n\nOne technique that may help is called cognitive reframing. This involves challenging and reframing negative thoughts or beliefs that contribute to your anxiety.

Ask yourself if there's evidence to support the idea that you have hidden secrets or flaws. Often, you'll find that there isn't.\n\nAnother helpful technique is deep breathing exercises. When you feel an anxiety attack coming on, take slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. This can help slow down your heart rate and reduce the physical sensations of anxiety.\n\nIn addition to these techniques, practicing self-care and stress management can also be beneficial.

The feelings you're experiencing are understandable given the loss of your close relative and the disconnect between your head and body. It's important to address these emotions and find healthy ways to cope with them.\n\nFirstly, it's important to acknowledge that grief is a complex and highly individualized experience. The fact that you're experiencing physical sensations like hand shaking and a desire to burst into tears suggests that these emotions are deeply ingrained. It's not uncommon for the grieving process to manifest in different ways, including physical sensations.\n\nOne approach to managing these feelings is to explore various coping mechanisms. While punching things might provide temporary relief, it's important to find more constructive ways to deal with your emotions. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Mindfulness techniques: Practice mindfulness exercises to help ground yourself in the present moment. Deep breathing, body scan, or guided meditation can help calm your body and mind.\n2. Emotional expression: Engage in activities that allow you to express and process your emotions in a healthy way. This could include writing in a journal, creating art, playing music, or engaging in any other form of expression that feels comfortable for you.\n3.

It's important to acknowledge that dealing with these feelings can be overwhelming, but there are some strategies that may help you find a mid-ground and manage your workload while also taking care of your mental health.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you've recognized the importance of taking small steps towards finding a solution. One approach you could consider is practicing self-compassion and prioritizing your well-being. This means being kind to yourself and acknowledging that it's okay to not be okay sometimes. Remember that you're not alone in this struggle, and many people experience similar challenges in their personal and professional lives.\n\nOne strategy you could try is incorporating relaxation techniques into your daily routine. Deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation can help reduce anxiety and promote a sense of calmness. These techniques can be done anywhere, even at work if you're feeling up to it. You could try taking short breaks throughout the day to practice these techniques and see if they help alleviate some of your stress and anxiety.\n\nAnother approach you could explore is re-evaluating your workload and finding ways to delegate or prioritize tasks. It's possible that you may be carrying too much responsibility on your own, which can contribute to feelings of overwhelm. Consider talking to your supervisor or colleagues about your workload and seeing if there are any tasks that can be delegated or reassigned. By distributing the workload more evenly, you may find it easier to manage your responsibilities while also taking care of your mental health.\n\nAdditionally, you may want to consider setting boundaries around your work hours. While it can be challenging to miss a day of work, sometimes taking a step back and recharging can be beneficial in the long run. You could try negotiating a flexible schedule with your employer or setting realistic goals for the day that are achievable and manageable. Remember, taking care of your mental health is essential for your overall well-being and productivity.\n\nLastly, seeking support from loved ones or a therapist can be incredibly helpful.

They can help minimize breakage and make it easier to detangle your hair.\n3. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner: Choose shampoos and conditioners that are formulated for curly hair. Look for products that are sulfate-free and contain ingredients that will help moisturize and define your curls. Avoid using harsh products that can strip your hair of its natural oils.\n4. Avoid excessive heat styling: High heat can damage your hair, especially if it's already struggling with knots. Try to limit your use of heat styling tools such as flat irons, curling irons, or blow dryers. Instead, let your hair air dry or use a microfiber towel to gently blot out excess moisture.\n5.
