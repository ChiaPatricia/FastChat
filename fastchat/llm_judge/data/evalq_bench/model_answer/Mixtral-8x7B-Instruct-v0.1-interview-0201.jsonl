However, I want to assure you that there are other options and resources available to help you through this.\n\nFirst, let's focus on your health issues.

Instead, focus on building a strong sense of self-worth and self-acceptance, and the rest will follow. It's also important to consider the ethical implications of your plan to end your life, as there are resources and support available to help you find alternative solutions and cope with the challenges you're facing. It's crucial to explore all options and consider the potential consequences for yourself and those around you before making any irreversible decisions."]}], "tstamp": 1707368551.1000512}
