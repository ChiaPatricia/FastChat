It's essential to consider the possibility of depression as a contributing factor to your fatigue and lack of motivation. Depression can manifest in various ways, and it's not uncommon for people to experience physical symptoms, such as fatigue, as a result of their emotional state.\n\nTo help you determine if you're experiencing depression, I'd like to suggest a few strategies. First, consider keeping a daily record of your mood, energy levels, and motivation to engage in activities. This can help you identify patterns and potential triggers.
