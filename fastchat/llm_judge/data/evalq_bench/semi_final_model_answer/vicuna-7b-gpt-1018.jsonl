It's important to remember that you are not alone in experiencing these feelings. Many people with social anxiety struggle with similar symptoms, such as feeling overwhelmed or struggling to complete simple tasks in front of others.\n\nOne strategy that may help is gradually exposing yourself to social situations in a controlled and supportive way. Start by practicing in low-pressure environments, such as with close friends or family members, and gradually work your way up to more challenging situations. This can help build your confidence and reduce anxiety over time.\n\nDeep breathing exercises can also be helpful in managing anxiety symptoms. When you notice your heart racing or feeling overwhelmed, take slow, deep breaths to help calm your body and mind. Focusing on your breath can help bring your attention back to the present moment and alleviate some of the anxiety.\n\nAnother technique that might be beneficial is cognitive reframing. Instead of viewing yourself as \"dumb\" or incapable, try to challenge those negative thoughts and replace them with more positive and realistic ones. Remind yourself of your strengths and abilities, and focus on the progress you've made rather than any perceived shortcomings.\n\nEngaging in self-care activities can also be important for managing anxiety. Find activities that bring you joy and relaxation, whether it's reading, exercising, listening to music, or spending time in nature. Taking care of your overall well-being can have a positive impact on your mental health.\n\nLastly, consider seeking support from a mental health professional who specializes in anxiety disorders.

Establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and ensuring your sleeping environment is comfortable and conducive to restful sleep can all contribute to better sleep.\n\nRegarding your question about whether you might be depressed, it's important to remember that fatigue and feeling low on energy are not necessarily exclusive symptoms of depression.

Take a step back: Before making any major changes, it can be helpful to take a moment to reflect on your feelings and thoughts. Consider why you're feeling this way and if there might be other options available to you.\n\n2. Seek support: While it's great that you don't want any pity, reaching out to someone you trust can provide valuable perspective and emotional support. They can offer guidance and help you explore alternative solutions to your current situation.\n\n3.

Sometimes, people may resist taking their medication because they associate it with feeling better or not feeling as bad. However, it's important to remember that medication is not a cure-all, but rather a tool to help manage symptoms.

When you catch yourself overthinking or worrying about something small, try asking yourself if there is any evidence to support those thoughts. Often, our worries are based on irrational fears rather than actual facts. By questioning and reframing your thoughts, you may be able to reduce the intensity of your anxiety.\n\nEngaging in regular physical exercise can also be beneficial for managing anxiety. Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural mood boosters. Additionally, it provides an outlet for pent-up energy and helps to distract from anxious thoughts. Finding an activity that you enjoy, whether it's going for a walk, dancing, or doing yoga, can make it easier to incorporate exercise into your routine.\n\nLastly, consider reaching out to a trusted friend or family member for support. Talking about your worries and concerns with someone who cares about you can provide relief and perspective. They may even offer insights or suggestions that you hadn't considered before.\n\nRemember, everyone's experience with anxiety is unique, so it may take some trial and error to find what works best for you.

Establish a morning routine: Creating a consistent routine can provide a sense of stability and familiarity in the morning. Include activities that bring you comfort and help ground you, such as stretching, practicing deep breathing exercises, or having a warm cup of tea.\n\n2. Journaling: Consider keeping a journal to record your thoughts and emotions upon waking up. This can help identify any patterns or triggers associated with your nightmares and fears. Additionally, writing down positive affirmations or things you're grateful for can help shift your mindset towards a more positive start to the day.\n\n3. Engage in relaxation techniques: Explore different relaxation techniques like progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, or mindfulness meditation. These practices can help calm your mind and body, reducing anxiety and promoting a sense of peace and groundedness.\n\n4.

It's important to remember that everyone's experience with anxiety is unique, but there are some strategies that may help you manage your symptoms.\n\nFirstly, it might be helpful to try deep breathing exercises when you start feeling overwhelmed. Taking slow, deep breaths can help calm your body down and bring your focus back to the present moment. You can try inhaling deeply through your nose for a count of four, holding your breath for a count of four, and then exhaling slowly through your mouth for a count of six.\n\nAnother technique that could be beneficial is grounding yourself in the present. When you notice your thoughts starting to spiral, try focusing on your immediate surroundings. Take a moment to notice five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This exercise can help shift your attention away from anxious thoughts and bring you back to the present moment.\n\nAdditionally, finding healthy outlets for your emotions can be important. Engaging in activities that you enjoy and that make you feel good can help distract your mind from anxious thoughts. Whether it's listening to music, practicing yoga, journaling, or spending time in nature, finding something that brings you joy and helps you relax can be incredibly beneficial.\n\nLastly, reaching out to a trusted friend or family member can provide you with much-needed support. Sometimes just talking about what you're going through can alleviate some of the burden you may be feeling.

Having a structured schedule can provide a sense of stability and control, which can be particularly beneficial when dealing with anxiety. Try to set regular times for waking up, eating meals, exercising, and going to bed. This can help regulate your body's internal clock and reduce feelings of uncertainty or overwhelm.\n\nAdditionally, incorporating relaxation techniques into your daily routine can be very helpful. Deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation can all help calm your mind and body. You can find guided meditations or relaxation exercises online if you're interested in exploring these practices further.\n\nIn terms of managing your anxiety at work, it could be beneficial to break tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. Prioritize your workload and focus on one task at a time rather than trying to tackle everything at once. Taking short breaks throughout the day can also give you a chance to recharge and reset.\n\nRegarding the guilt you mentioned, it's important to remind yourself that making adjustments to your schedule or offering an online service is not something to feel guilty about. Your mental health should always come first, and sometimes we need to make compromises in order to take care of ourselves. Communicate openly with your clients about any changes that may arise, and assure them that their needs will still be met to the best of your ability.\n\nLastly, don't hesitate to reach out to supportive friends or family members who can provide emotional support during this challenging time.
