It's important to remember that everyone experiences anxiety differently, and it's completely normal for your symptoms to manifest in ways that may seem unusual or unexpected.\n\nYour description of feeling like your brain goes to mush and having difficulty with tasks like counting money when you're in social situations is a common experience for people with social anxiety. This can be due to the increased heart rate and adrenaline that comes with anxiety, which can make it harder for us to focus and process information as effectively as we would like.\n\nDissociation is another common symptom of anxiety, and it can make it feel like you're observing yourself from outside your own body. This can make it even more difficult to engage in social situations and perform tasks that might be challenging for you.\n\nIt's important to remember that you're not alone in this experience, and that there are many things you can do to help manage your social anxiety and make it easier to perform tasks in social situations. Some people find that practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, can help reduce their anxiety and make it easier to focus. Others find that using visualization or positive self-talk can help them feel more confident and capable.\n\nIt's also important to remember that it's okay to ask for help or accommodations when you need them. For example, if counting money is particularly challenging for you in social situations, you might ask if you can use a calculator or if someone else can help you count the money. It's also okay to take breaks or remove yourself from social situations if they become too overwhelming.\n\nI hope this information is helpful, and I'm here if you have any other questions or if you'd like to talk more about your experiences with social anxiety.

While you mentioned that you don't feel sad or hopeless, it's important to know that depression isn't always characterized by these feelings. Fatigue, constant hunger, and feeling like a shell of yourself are all common symptoms of depression.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that these symptoms could be related to other conditions, such as chronic fatigue syndrome or an underlying medical condition. It's important to continue working with your healthcare provider to rule out any potential medical causes.\n\nIf you're unsure whether you might be depressed, it might be helpful to consider the following questions:\n\n1. Have you experienced a significant change in your energy levels for a prolonged period of time?\n2. Do you feel a lack of interest or pleasure in activities that you used to enjoy?\n3. Do you feel tired even after getting a full night's sleep?\n4. Do you have trouble focusing or making decisions?\n5. Do you feel worthless or guilty?\n6. Do you have thoughts of death or suicide?\n\nIf you answer \"yes\" to several of these questions, it might be worth discussing your symptoms with a mental health professional. They can help you determine whether depression or another condition might be contributing to your symptoms.\n\nIt's also important to remember that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. If you're feeling tired and unmotivated, it's okay to ask for support.

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now, from adjusting to a new car and feeling anxious about driving, to feeling disconnected from your job and coworkers, and struggling with self-doubt and insecurity in your personal life.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the car. It's natural to feel anxious about something new, especially if it's something as significant as a car. But remember that feeling anxious doesn't mean that you're incapable of learning how to drive it or that something bad will happen. You might find it helpful to practice driving in a safe and controlled environment, like an empty parking lot or a quiet residential street. You could also consider taking a driving lesson or two to help build your confidence.\n\nNext, let's talk about your job. It's understandable that you might feel disconnected from your job or your coworkers, but it's important to remember that everyone has off days and everyone experiences feelings of disconnection from time to time. If you're feeling disconnected, try to identify what's causing those feelings. Is it the work itself, or is it something about your coworkers or the work environment? Once you've identified the root cause, you might be able to find ways to address it.\n\nRegarding your personal life, it's normal to feel insecure or self-conscious at times, but it's important to remember that everyone has unique qualities and value to offer. You mentioned feeling embarrassed about who you are and feeling like you're boring or not interesting to talk to. But remember that everyone has different perspectives and interests, and there's likely someone out there who would find you fascinating.\n\nLastly, it's important to remember that change can be scary, but it can also be exciting and rewarding. If you're feeling stuck or unsure about making a change, it might be helpful to start small. Try setting small goals for yourself, like learning a new skill or taking a class, and gradually build up to bigger changes.\n\nI hope this information is helpful, and please know that it's okay to reach out for support when you need it. If you're feeling overwhelmed or unable to cope, consider reaching out to a mental health professional for additional support.

It's important to remember that these feelings are valid and common, but there are several techniques you can use to help manage your anxiety during this time.\n\nFirst, try practicing deep breathing exercises.

It's clear that your current situation is causing you a great deal of pain and sadness, and it's understandable that you might be considering running away or starting a new life. However, it's also important to consider the potential consequences of such a decision, particularly with regards to your family and your brother, who you seem to care about deeply.\n\nLeaving your family and your current environment might provide you with a fresh start and a chance to heal from the pain and sadness that you've been experiencing. However, it's also important to consider the potential risks and challenges that come with such a decision. For example, starting a new life can be difficult and uncertain, and it might be challenging to find a new support system or to make new friends.

Here are a few suggestions that might be helpful:\n\n1. Exposure therapy: This is a type of therapy that can be effective for people with eating disorders and food-related anxiety. The basic idea is to gradually expose yourself to the things that trigger your anxiety (in this case, food) in a safe and controlled way. This can help your body and mind learn that these things aren't dangerous, and that you can eat them without negative consequences.\n2. Mindfulness practices: Mindfulness practices, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises, can help you manage your anxiety in the moment. They can help you focus on the present moment rather than getting caught up in your thoughts and fears.\n3. Cognitive restructuring: This is a technique that can help you challenge and reframe negative thoughts. For example, instead of thinking \"I'll gain weight if I eat this,\" you might reframe it as \"I'm allowing myself to eat this food and trusting my body to handle it.\"\n4. Support groups: Connecting with other people who have similar experiences can be helpful and validating. You might consider joining a support group for people with eating disorders or anxiety.\n5. Self-care: Taking care of yourself in other ways can help improve your overall well-being and reduce your anxiety. This might include things like getting enough sleep, eating regular meals, engaging in physical activity, and doing things that bring you joy.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful. Remember, recovery is a process and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You're not alone in this, and there are resources and support available to help you.

Here are some steps you can take to ensure you're getting the help you need:\n\n1. Look for apps that are certified by trusted organizations: Many mental health organizations, such as the American Psychological Association (APA) and the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), have lists of approved mental health apps.

This behavior is common among people, especially during times of stress or anxiety. It's a form of self-soothing and can be difficult to break. You've mentioned that you've tried to quit in the past, but the habit returns when you notice even the slightest imperfection on your nails. This behavior can be a sign of anxiety or stress, but it can also be a habit that's been with you for a long time. If you're interested in addressing this habit, there are several techniques you can try on your own, such as keeping your nails short to make biting less appealing, using bitter-tasting nail polish, or wearing gloves when you feel the urge to bite.\n\nNext, let's discuss your overthinking and ruminating thoughts. It's common for people to replay scenarios in their heads and worry about what others might think of them. However, if these thoughts are causing you significant distress and interfering with your daily life, it might be a sign of anxiety or depression. It's important to remember that everyone has thoughts that are critical or negative at times, but it's how we respond to these thoughts that matters. Try practicing mindfulness meditation or cognitive-behavioral techniques to help you challenge negative thoughts and focus on the present moment.\n\nRegarding your attention span and distractibility, it's common for people to have difficulty focusing on tasks, especially when they're not under pressure. However, if you're finding it difficult to focus for extended periods of time, even when there's no external pressure, it might be a sign of ADHD or another condition. It's important to note that ADHD is not just about being easily distracted; it's also about difficulty with impulse control and hyperactivity. If you're concerned about your attention span, consider keeping a journal of your daily activities and noting when you're most focused and when you're most distracted. This information can be helpful for a mental health professional if you decide to seek a diagnosis.\n\nIn summary, while it's important to consider seeking a professional diagnosis if you're concerned about your mental health, there are also things you can do on your own to address some of the behaviors you've described.

It's understandable that you may feel overwhelmed and tired of dealing with these feelings, but I encourage you to reach out for support.\n\nThere are many resources available to help you navigate these emotions. You may consider speaking with a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, who can provide you with tools and strategies to help manage your thoughts and feelings.

These resources can provide a sense of community and understanding, and can help you feel less alone in your struggles.\n\nRemember, it's okay to ask for help and it's okay to take the time you need to focus on your mental health. You are not alone in this, and there are people and resources available to support you.\n\nIf you're feeling suicidal or in crisis, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) in the US, or contact a crisis center in your country for immediate assistance.\n\nI hope this information is helpful and provides you with some guidance on how to move forward.

It's important to remember that you're not alone in this experience, although it may not be as commonly discussed as other symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety can manifest in many different ways, and vomiting is indeed a possible symptom for some people.\n\nThe exact cause of anxiety-related vomiting isn't fully understood, but it's believed to be related to the body's stress response. During a panic attack, your body may respond by increasing the production of stomach acid, which can lead to nausea and vomiting. This can be particularly distressing, as the vomiting can sometimes feel like it's perpetuating the anxiety cycle.\n\nIt's important to note that while vomiting can be a symptom of anxiety, it can also be a sign of other medical conditions. If you're experiencing frequent vomiting, it may be a good idea to speak with your healthcare provider to rule out any underlying medical conditions. They may be able to provide you with additional resources or treatments to help manage your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, there are several things you can try to help manage your anxiety and reduce the frequency and severity of your vomiting episodes:\n\n1. Practice relaxation techniques: Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness meditation can all help to reduce anxiety and calm your body.\n2. Avoid triggers: Identify the things that tend to trigger your anxiety and try to avoid them as much as possible. This might include certain places, people, or situations.\n3. Stay hydrated: Dehydration can make vomiting worse, so it's important to stay hydrated. Try sipping on small amounts of water or clear fluids throughout the day.\n4. Eat small, frequent meals: Eating smaller meals more frequently can help to keep your blood sugar levels stable and reduce the severity of your symptoms.\n5. Consider therapy: Therapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), can be an effective way to learn new skills and strategies for managing anxiety.\n\nI hope this information is helpful, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.

It's important to know that you're not alone in this, as many people with anxiety disorders, including Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), report experiencing shortness of breath as a symptom.\n\nThe physical sensations you're describing, such as shaking, tingling, and feeling like you'll stop breathing, are common symptoms of anxiety and can be quite alarming. However, it's important to remember that these symptoms are a result of your body's natural response to stress and anxiety, and they are not a sign that you're actually in danger of harm.\n\nThere are several coping mechanisms that may help you manage these symptoms when they arise. One effective technique is called \"box breathing.\" This involves inhaling slowly through your nose for a count of four, holding the breath for a count of four, exhaling slowly through your mouth for a count of four, and then holding the exhale for a count of four. Repeating this cycle several times can help calm the body and mind, and can help reduce the sensation of shortness of breath.\n\nAnother helpful technique is called \"grounding.\" This involves focusing your attention on something in your environment, such as the sensation of the ground beneath your feet, the feeling of the air on your skin, or the taste of a favorite food. By focusing your attention on something tangible and present, you can help shift your focus away from the anxiety and the physical symptoms, and can help bring a sense of calm and stability.\n\nIt may also be helpful to practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization, on a regular basis. These techniques can help strengthen your ability to manage anxiety symptoms when they arise, and can help improve your overall mental and emotional well-being.\n\nI would also recommend speaking with your mental health provider about your symptoms and any additional coping strategies they may be able to suggest. They may be able to provide you with additional resources, such as therapy or medication, to help manage your anxiety and improve your overall well-being.\n\nRemember, it's important to be patient and compassionate with yourself as you work to manage your anxiety and the physical symptoms that come with it.

They may receive a comprehensive assessment, medication adjustments, and therapy sessions that help them gain the tools and skills they need to manage their depression.\n\nHowever, it's also common for people to feel resistant or reluctant about going to a mental hospital, especially if they've had negative experiences in the past or if they're worried about the stigma associated with mental health treatment. It's important to remember that these feelings are normal and valid, and that it's okay for your spouse to feel angry and betrayed by his counselor's recommendation.\n\nIf your spouse does decide to stay in the mental hospital, there are things you can do to support him during this time. You can visit him regularly, bring him small comforts from home, and help him maintain a sense of routine and normalcy as much as possible. You can also advocate for him with the hospital staff and make sure that his needs are being met.\n\nWhen he comes home, it's important to continue the healing process by creating a supportive and nurturing environment.

I understand that the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as a racing heart and feeling on edge, can be debilitating and make it difficult to relax or enjoy activities.\n\nIt's not uncommon for people to experience limited relief from anxiety medications like Effexor XR, Lexapro, and Zoloft. In fact, some people may not respond to these medications at all. Buspirone is an alternative medication that is sometimes used to treat anxiety. It works differently than the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) you've tried, and it may help to reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as a racing heart and muscle tension.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Buspirone may take several weeks to start working, and it may not be effective for everyone. Additionally, it can have side effects, such as dizziness, drowsiness, and headaches. It's important to discuss the potential benefits and risks of Buspirone with your doctor before trying it.\n\nOther approaches that may help manage anxiety symptoms include:\n\n* Psychotherapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) can be effective in helping people manage anxiety. These therapies can help you identify and challenge negative thought patterns, learn coping skills, and develop a more mindful and accepting attitude towards your anxiety.\n* Lifestyle changes: Regular exercise, a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, and reducing stress can all help improve anxiety symptoms.\n* Mindfulness practices: Mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, and progressive muscle relaxation can help you relax and reduce anxiety.\n* Complementary therapies: Acupuncture, massage, and yoga have been shown to help some people with anxiety.\n\nIt's also important to remember that finding relief from anxiety and depression can be a long and challenging process.

I encourage you to keep an open mind and continue exploring different options with your healthcare provider.\n\nI hope this information is helpful.

Exposure therapy: This involves deliberately exposing yourself to situations that make you anxious about your stutter, such as speaking in public or introducing yourself to new people.
